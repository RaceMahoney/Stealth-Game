# How to play #
The point of any steath based game is to not be see, the same is true here. Since you have no weapons your only option is to stay out of the line of sight of the enemy. However, if you are seen then run and hide, eventually the guards will stop chasing you but they will remember where you were last spotted and created a new patrol route based on that location.

# How it is different #
Originally, this game began as a lab assignment for my Artificial Intelligence class, however it evolved into my final project for the class with my own added feature. When you are spotted, the enemy will chase you down and try to capture you. If you break the line of sight, the enemy will remember where he last saw you and create a new randomized patrol route, based off that last sighted position in a 10 by 10 radius that us unknown to the player.
